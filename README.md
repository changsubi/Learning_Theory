# Probability
Event : a subset of the sample space
probability is assigned to events   
Axioms :   
nonnegativity : P(A) $\geq$ 0   
normalization : P(S) = 1

Def. Conditional Probability   
Probability of A, given that B occurred   
P(A|B) = P(A $\cap$ B) / P(B)   
only when P(B)>0
   
Partition of sample space into $A_1, A_2, A_3, ... $
